# Creating anime characters using DCGANs and Keras
## Author : Cognitive Class AI
--------------------------------

Mass production of millions of unique anime characters is nearly impossible for the best painter, but it is easy using machine learning method! In the guided project, you will have the chance to build machine learning models and produce the anime characters for yourself. After then, you will also handle the machine learning method called Deep Convolutional Generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), which is used for the mass anime production.
